Now, let's define our instruments:

1. Drums (circles): Large circles for bass drum and smaller ones for snare/symbols.
2. Violins (rectangles): Vertical rectangles for the violin strings.
3. Guitars (paths): Complex paths for guitar shapes.

Next, let's assign note values with sizes and positions. For simplicity, we'll use sizes to represent note lengths:

- Whole note = diameter of 40
- Half note = diameter of 20
- Quarter note = diameter of 10

Rhythm will be represented by the position of notes on the staff (y-axis):

- Top staff line (y=30) = beat 1
- Middle staff line (y=0) = beat 2
- Bottom staff line (y=-30) = beat 3

For harmony, we'll use different colors for each instrument:

- Drums: Black (#000)
- Violins: Orange (#FFA500)
- Guitars: Blue (#00F)

Finally, let's create a simple SVG score. Here's a short excerpt in 4/4 time:

```svg
<circle cx="-200" cy="30" r="20" fill="#000"/> <!-- Kick drum on beat 1 -->
<circle cx="-150" cy="0" r="10" fill="#000"/>   <!-- Snare/hihat on beat 2 -->
<rect x="-100" y="-30" width="40" height="60" fill="#FFA500"/> <!-- Violin strings playing half notes -->

<!-- Guitar solo starts here, with a crescendo in color intensity -->
<path d="M-50 -30 Q-100 0 -50 30 Q0 0 -50 -30" fill="#00F"/>
<animate attributeName="fill-opacity" values="0;1" dur="2s" repeatCount="indefinite"/>

<!-- More notes can be added following the same pattern -->
