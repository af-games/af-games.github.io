Next, let's assign note values to our instruments. We'll use different radii for circles (drums), heights for rectangles (violins), and stroke widths for paths (guitars) to represent note duration. Longer notes will have larger radii, taller rectangles, or wider strokes.

```xml
<circle cx="150" cy="100" r="30" fill="blue" />
<rect x="250" y="60" width="50" height="80" fill="green" />
<path d="M350 70 H400 V150 H350 Z" stroke="red" stroke-width="20"/>
```

Now, let's add some rhythm and harmony. We'll create a simple melody by moving the notes around and varying their sizes.

```xml
<circle cx="150" cy="100" r="30" fill="blue" /> <!-- Drum hit -->
<rect x="250" y="60" width="50" height="80" fill="green" /> <!-- Violin plays a long note -->
<path d="M350 70 H400 V150 H350 Z" stroke="red" stroke-width="20"/> <!-- Guitar strums -->

<circle cx="200" cy="100" r="20" fill="blue" /> <!-- Drum plays a shorter note -->
<rect x="400" y="60" width="50" height="60" fill="green" /> <!-- Violin plays a medium note -->

<circle cx="250" cy="100" r="35" fill="blue" /> <!-- Drum plays a longer note -->
<rect x="450" y="60" width="50" height="70" fill="green" /> <!-- Violin plays a long note -->

<!-- More notes can be added following this pattern -->
```

For dynamics, we'll use colors to represent crescendos (brighter colors) and decrescendos (darker colors). We'll also vary the opacity for additional dynamic effect.

```xml
<circle cx="150" cy="100" r="30" fill="steelblue" opacity="0.8"/> <!-- Crescendo -->
<rect x="250" y="60" width="50" height="80" fill="limegreen" /> <!-- Normal -->
<path d="M350 70 H400 V150 H350 Z" stroke="darkred" opacity="0.9"/> <!-- Decrescendo -->

<!-- More notes with varying colors and opacities can be added following this pattern -->
```

Finally, let's close the SVG tag to complete our visual symphony.
