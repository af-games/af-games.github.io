2. **Outline and basic shape**: I'd begin by sketching the mermaid's outline with simple paths for the head, body, tail, and hair. I'll use the `<path>` element with the `d` attribute to define these curves.

```svg
<path d="M150 30 Q270 40, 390 80 A10 10 0 0 0 300 150 L300 250 Q350 200, 450 250 V300 H150 Z"/>
```

3. **Body details**: Next, I'd add details like arms and breasts with more `<path>` elements. For the tail, I'll use a series of connected curves to create a flowing effect.

```svg
<path d="M400 270 Q450 250, 480 270 L480 360 Q450 390, 400 420 Z"/>
```

4. **Hair and fin details**: For the hair, I'll use `<polygon>` elements to create sharp, flowing lines. The tail fin will be created using a combination of `<path>` for the base and `<polygon>` for the detailed edges.

```svg
<polygon points="390 70, 420 50, 410 20"/>
<path d="M480 360 Q490 380, 500 370 L510 390 Z"/>
```

5. **Scaling and refining**: Once the basic shape is complete, I'd scale up the mermaid for better detail control. Then, I'll refine each element by adding more points to curves and adjusting their control points.

6. **Coloring**: To bring my mermaid to life, I'll use `<linearGradient>` or `<radialGradient>` to create a smooth color transition across her body.

```svg
<defs>
  <linearGradient id="grad1" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="100%">
    <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:blue;stop-opacity:1" />
    <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:green;stop-opacity:1" />
  </linearGradient>
</defs>
```

7. **Final touches**: I'll add a fill color and stroke to complete the mermaid's appearance.

```svg
<path d="..." fill="url(#grad1)" stroke="black"/>
```

8. **Closing tags**: Finally, I'll close the `<svg>` tag to complete my digital masterpiece.
