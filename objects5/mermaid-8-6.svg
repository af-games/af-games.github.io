2. **Create the background**: Add a gradient background to serve as the base of your tapestry. We'll use a radial gradient going from light blue at the top (`#B3E5FC`) to dark blue at the bottom (`#1F456C`).

```svg
<defs>
  <linearGradient id="gradient" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="0%" y2="100%">
    <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#B3E5FC; stop-opacity:1" />
    <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#1F456C; stop-opacity:1" />
  </linearGradient>
</defs>
<rect width="800" height="800" fill="url(#gradient)" />
```

3. **Start at the edges**: Begin weaving your design by creating the outline of the mermaid and filling it with a light blue color (`#6FBFFF`).

```svg
<polygon points="400,25 700,150 700,250 300,180 100,250 100,150" fill="#6FBFFF" />
```

4. **Build up intricate details in the center**: Now that you have the basic outline, start adding details like scales, hair, and accessories using interconnected patterns of lines and shapes.

   - Mermaid scales: Use a `pattern` element to create a repeating scale pattern, then apply it to the mermaid's body using a `mask`.

```svg
<defs>
  <!-- Scale pattern -->
  <pattern id="scales" width="20" height="15">
    <path d="M0,0 L20,7.5 Z" fill="#6FBFFF"/>
  </pattern>

  <!-- Mermaid mask for scales -->
  <mask id="mermaid-mask">
    <rect x="40" y="30" width="360" height="180" fill="url(#scales)" />
  </mask>
</defs>
<path d="M400,25 Q600,75 700,150 Q700,225 300,180 Q100,225 100,150 Q400,75 400,25" stroke="#4D648D" fill="url(#mermaid-mask)" />
```

   - Hair: Create a series of connected lines for the mermaid's flowing hair using `<path>` elements with cubic BÃ©zier curves.

   - Accessories (e.g., seashells, pearls): Add decorative shapes like circles, ovals, and stars as SVG paths or polygon shapes.

5. **Ensure harmony throughout the design**: Maintain harmony by using consistent colors, line widths, and patterns throughout your tapestry. Use gradients and opacity to create depth and dimension in your design.

6. **Translate the tapestry into an SVG file**: Once you've finished weaving your mermaid tapestry, save the contents of the `<svg>` element as a `.svg` file. For example:

```svg
<svg width="800" height="800" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Contents of your tapestry go here -->
