*Observation:* Kangaroos have distinct body shapes and colors. I'll need resources like circles (`<circle>`), rectangles (`<rect>`), and paths (`<path>`) for their bodies, pouches, and limbs. Colors will include browns (#8B4513), greys (#A9A9A9), and whites (#FFFFFF).

**Day 2:**
Gathered resources:

- Brown (`#8B4513`) for the body.
- Grey (`#A9A9A9`) for details like limbs and pouch.
- White (`#FFFFFF`) for highlights on paws and ears.

Marked path with `<circle>` for the body, `<rect>` for the pouch, and `<path>` for the limbs, head, and tail:
