<svg>` tag with appropriate dimensions and viewBox attributes to provide enough space for the owl sculpture.

2. **Create basic shapes**: I'd begin by sketching out the broad forms of the owl using `<ellipse>` and `<rect>` elements for the body, head, wings, and eyes.

3. **Establish the main body**: Using an `<ellipse>`, I'd carve out the owls body, ensuring it's central to the composition and serves as a stable foundation for the rest of the sculpture.

4. **Add wings**: Wings would be created using two overlapping `<path>` elements with smooth curves (`<path d="M...C..."`) to achieve the desired shape.

5. **Define the head and face**: An `<ellipse>` for the head and `<circle>`s for the eyes will start to give the owl its distinctive look. The face might also include a `<polygon>` for the beak.

6. **Add details**: Details like feathers, wrinkles around the eyes, and patterns on the wings can be created using `<path>` elements with intricate curves (`<path d="M...Q..."`) to capture the owl's texture and character.

7. **Refine and balance**: Throughout this process, I'd continually check the balance of the sculpture by adjusting the size and placement of each element relative to one another. The owl should appear proportionate and harmonious within its virtual environment.

8. **Final touches**: Lastly, I'd add the final details like highlights on the eyes using `<circle>` with suitable opacity, and perhaps a few `<line>` elements for any fine wrinkles or feather lines.

Here's an SVG representation of an owl sculpture following this process:
