<svg>` tag.

2. **Create the basic form**: Begin with the broadest shapes – the body, head, wings, and tail feathers. Use `<ellipse>`, `<rect>`, and `<polygon>` elements to establish these forms.

3. **Establish the pose**: Determine the owl's posture by adjusting the positions and sizes of the basic shapes. This will serve as the foundation for the sculpture.

4. **Add curves**: Introduce curves using `<path>` elements with Bézier curve commands (e.g., `C`, `Q`, `A`) to define the outline of the feathers, wings, and body.

5. **Refine details**: Gradually add more details like eye shapes, beak, talons, and individual feather patterns using combinations of `<circle>`, `<ellipse>`, `<path>`, and other SVG elements.

6. **Create depth and shading**: Use `<linearGradient>` and `<radialGradient>` to create shaded areas that give the owl a sense of depth and dimension.

7. **Define colors**: Assign colors to each element using `fill` attributes to bring life to your sculpture.

Here's an example of how you might write this SVG code, creating a simple owl sculpture with just basic shapes and forms:

```svg
<svg width="300" height="300" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

  <!-- Body -->
  <ellipse cx="150" cy="200" rx="80" ry="120" fill="#694F3B"/>

  <!-- Head -->
  <ellipse cx="150" cy="120" rx="60" ry="70" fill="#694F3B"/>

  <!-- Wings -->
  <path d="M100 150 Q120 180, 150 210" stroke="black" fill="transparent"/>
  <path d="M200 150 Q180 180, 150 210" stroke="black" fill="transparent"/>

  <!-- Tail feathers -->
  <polygon points="220,230 260,270 240,290" fill="#694F3B"/>
